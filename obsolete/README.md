# Obsolete images

The following images are now obsolete:

*   [`google/ruby`](https://hub.docker.com/r/google/ruby/)
*   [`google/ruby-runtime`](https://hub.docker.com/r/google/ruby-runtime/)
*   [`google/ruby-hello`](https://hub.docker.com/r/google/ruby-hello/)

If you want to deploy a Ruby application to Google App Engine, please use gcr.io/google_appengine/ruby as your base image. See http://cloud.google.com/ruby for more information on using Ruby on Google Cloud Platform.

If you are looking for a generic Ruby base image, consider the [official Ruby image on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/_/ruby/).
